âœ… Check if a Number is Prime
A number is prime if it has exactly two divisors â€” 1 and itself.

ðŸ”¸ Java Code (Basic Approach)

class Solution {
    static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                c++;
            }
        }
        return c == 2;
    }
}



ðŸ”¸ Python Code (Basic Approach)

class Solution:
    def isPrime(self, n):
        c = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                c += 1
        return c == 2
ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s happening?

We count how many numbers divide n.

If the count is exactly 2, itâ€™s prime (only divisible by 1 and itself).
